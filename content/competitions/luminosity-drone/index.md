## Overview
Developed an autonomous quadcopter system as part of the **IIT Bombay e-Yantra Robotics
Competition (2023–24)** under the *Luminosity Drone* theme.  
The objective was to enable autonomous exploration, detection, and navigation in a
simulated environment.

## Key Contributions
- Implemented autonomous exploration and waypoint navigation for a quadcopter.
- Developed object detection and clustering pipelines for scene understanding.
- Integrated **WhyCon-based localization** for precise pose estimation.
- Designed and tuned **PID controllers** to improve flight stability and accuracy.
- Created and integrated a **custom ROS message format** for drone telemetry and control.

## Technical Stack
- **Middleware & Simulation:** ROS 2, Gazebo, RViz  
- **Perception:** OpenCV, WhyCon  
- **Control:** PID Controller, BetaFlight concepts  
- **Programming:** Python  

## Outcome
- Selected as **Semi-Finalist** at IIT Bombay e-Yantra Robotics Competition.
- Demonstrated robust autonomous navigation and perception under competition constraints.
- Gained hands-on experience in aerial robotics, control systems, and ROS-based simulation.
