## About Me

I’m **Aakshar Garg**, an **AI & Machine Learning engineer** working at the intersection of **machine learning, computer vision, and robotics AI**. I focus on building **production-oriented intelligent systems**—from data pipelines and model training to perception, autonomy, and real-world deployment.

My work spans **applied ML and deep learning**, where I’ve designed and fine-tuned models for **object detection, instance segmentation, clustering, and pattern discovery**. I’ve worked extensively with **YOLOv8, OpenCV**, and classical ML techniques such as **DBSCAN and K-Means**, applying them to unstructured, noisy data and real-world perception problems.

In robotics-centric projects, I’ve applied ML within **ROS 2–based systems**, combining vision, spatial reasoning, and control. This includes **point-cloud processing, surface extraction, octomap generation, transform (TF) estimation**, and simulation-to-hardware workflows using Gazebo and GZ-Harmonic. I care deeply about **system robustness, interpretability, and real-world performance**, not just model accuracy.

Beyond individual projects, I actively lead and scale teams. As **President of A.T.O.M Robotics Lab**, I drive **project-based learning**, mentor students across AI and robotics domains, organize technical workshops and events, and manage sponsorships and collaborations. I’ve also participated in **national-level robotics competitions**, gaining experience with time-bound, high-pressure engineering problem statements.

## What Drives Me

I enjoy working on problems where **AI meets reality**—clean architectures, scalable systems, and intelligent solutions that operate reliably outside controlled demos. I’m particularly interested in opportunities involving **applied machine learning, perception systems, robotics AI, and intelligent automation**.
